Vidiom - your wandering eye.

Vidom is a video capture and web video publishing tool.

The Vidiom application for Android devices (using Android 2.1-update1 and higher) captures MP4 video (using H263 and AMR-NB codecs), and allows you to publish them to a variety of video hosting services. You can publish to Facebook, YouTube, videobin.org, and video CMS sites like Plumi that allow FTP publishing. You can also tweet the hosted video URL to twitter.com. Vidiom also now allows you to import previously recorded videos from other applications, from the SD card and publish them to hosting services.

Vidiom allows you to setup automatic publishing options to the services above after each video is recorded by the inbuilt camera. You will also get email notifications of video sucessfully published.

Galaxy S users : Dont install the application yet - there is a known serious bug when you start recording video.

If you leave feedback about the application please include your phone's model so we can arrange to test the application on that type of phone.

Open source application covered by the GNU GPL v3.
