{"name":"Vidiom","body":"# Vidiom - your wandering eye.\r\n\r\n## Vidom is a video capture and web video publishing tool.\r\n\r\nThe Vidiom application for Android devices captures MP4 video and allows you to publish them to a variety of video hosting services. The video and audio codecs used in the recorded video files are dependent on the phone model and the selected quality setting.\r\n\r\nThere is a in-build video editor, allowing you to trim the video on the phone before publishing.\r\n\r\nYou can publish recorded videos to Facebook, YouTube, videobin.org, and video CMS sites like Plumi that allow FTP publishing. You can also email the recorded video as an attachment, or email or tweet the hosted video URL. Vidiom allows you to import previously recorded videos from other applications, from the SD card and publish them to hosting services.\r\n\r\nVidiom allows you to setup automatic publishing to the services listed above after each video is recorded. You will also get email notifications of video successfully published.\r\n\r\nIf you leave feedback about the application please include your phone's model so we can arrange to test the application on that type of phone.\r\n","tagline":"Vidiom is a video capture and web video publishing tool.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
